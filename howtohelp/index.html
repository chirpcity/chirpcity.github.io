    <h1>Tactful Ways to Encourage Others to Help the Birds</h1>
    <h3>Preventing birds from colliding with windows</h3>

    Preventing birds from colliding with windows
    During migration season, birds may mistake windows for openings. This, combined with plants and bright lights behind the windows, and the reflection properties of windows can confuse birds. Follow these easy steps to make your home and office safer for birds:<br>
1. Turn off lights in empty offices. (Artificial lights can disorient migrating birds).<br>
2. Remove plants from windowsills. (Birds may attempt to fly through your window to get to your beautiful plant)<br>
3. Close your blinds, at least 3/4 to help birds to see the window.<br>
4. Soap large panes of glass that do not have blinds.<br>

    <h3>Giving birds the nutrition they need</h3>

    Giving birds the nutrition they need
Bread is not the best choice for feeding birds in any season because it lacks nutritional value, it can be moldy, and regular feeding causes birds to be too around, even possibly dependent on, humans. The inbalance in the birds fecal matter can then create overgrowth of bacteria and algae. Follow these steps to feed birds:<br>
1. Set up a bird feeder in your backyard or by your window. This will teach birds to find their own food, and bird feed is tailored specifically to give birds the nutrition they need.<br>

2. Instead of feeding birds bread, feed them oats, grains, seeds, grapes, or peas. These also provide nutrition for birds.<br>For more ideas, visit <a href="http://chirpcity.github.io/howtohelp/recipes">ChirpCity Recipes</a> and <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/feeding_birds.html">humanesociety.org</a>.</p>
  <h3>Spreading the word</h3>
  <p>The best way to make a difference is to talk to others about the issue. When you see someone feeding birds in the park, you can remind them: "Did you know that instead of bread, which has no nutritional value, a safer and better option would be to feed the birds oats, grains, seeds, and dried halved grapes or frozen peas. This will help keep the water clean too." When you visit a friendâ€™s home during migration season, you can suggest: "You know, it might be a good idea to use a window shade in this room to reduce the reflection and avoid birds flying into the glass, so you can help the birds, and yourself by not having to scoop up the bird and go through that trauma."</p>
